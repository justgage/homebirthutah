      <description>For more than half my lifetime (since 1985), I have been working with childbearing women and families. I have always believed that women had everything they needed to birth their babies calmly, gently, safely, and well. It has been my calling and I have experienced an immeasurable amount of joy being involved in the miracle of childbirth.
How women give birth matters! It literally changes who we are and the confidence with which we parent and care for the needs of our little ones.</description>
